<h1>Hi, I'm Xavier!</h1>
I'm from Brooklyn New York. I graduated from Colby College with a degree in Computer Science focusing in AI and audio software development. I have a passion for music and all of the technical aspects involved in the creation of it from theory, to production, to mixing and mastering. Feel free to take a look at my projects, connect with me on Linkedin, or send me an email!
